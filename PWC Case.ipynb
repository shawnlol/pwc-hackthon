Each retail foreign exchange dealer, futures commission merchant or introducing broker shall file with the Commission prior notice of any transfer of accounts of any retail forex customer that is not initiated at the request of the customer, where the transfer involves 50 percent or more of the transferor's total number of retail forex customer accounts.\\n(c) Contents of notice to the Commission. The notice required by paragraph (b) of this section shall include:\\n(1) The name, principal business address and telephone number of the transferor futures retail foreign exchange dealer, futures commission merchant or introducing broker;\\n(2) The name, principal business address and telephone number of each transferee retail foreign exchange dealer, futures commission merchant or introducing broker;\\n(3) The designated self-regulatory organization for the transferor and transferee firms;\\n(4) A brief statement as to the reasons for the transfer;\\n(5) A copy of any notices to customers regarding the transfers; and\\n(6) A statement of the number of accounts to be transferred.\\n(d) Notice of the bulk liquidation of retail forex transactions. A retail foreign exchange dealer or futures commission merchant may not initiate the bulk liquidation of properly margined retail forex transactions unless such liquidation complies with the rules and procedures of the retail forex dealer's or futures commission merchant's designated self-regulatory organization and the retail forex dealer or futures commission merchant provides the Commission with prior written notice of the liquidation.\\n(e) Contents of notice of bulk liquidation. The notice required by paragraph (d) of this section shall include:\\n(1) The name, principal business address and telephone number of the initiating retail foreign exchange dealer or futures commission merchant;\\n(2) A brief statement of the reasons for the liquidation;\\n(3) A copy of any notices to customers regarding the liquidation; and\\n(4) A statement of the number of accounts to be liquidated.\\n(f) Filing of notices.

If a proposed transfer is not completed in accordance with the notice required to be filed by paragraph (b) of this section, a corrective notice shall be filed within five business days of the date such proposed transfer was to occur explaining why the proposed transfer was not completed.\\n[75 FR 55432, Sept. 10, 2010, as amended at 78 FR 22419, Apr. 16, 2013]\\n\",\n",
